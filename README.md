"Perform a penetration test on this API"
```

**Robotics:**
```
"My robot keeps drifting, can you help debug the localization?"
"How do I fuse GPS with IMU data for better positioning?"
"Review my ROS node for sensor integration issues"
```

**Development:**
```
"Help me debug this Python code"
"Review my implementation for bugs"
"I need to plan a new feature"
```
